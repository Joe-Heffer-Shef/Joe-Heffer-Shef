Hi, I'm a senior engineer at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/) where I collaborate with and support researchers from all disciplines in using data technology in various ways as part of their projects.

I mostly use the following skills:
- Software engineering and data analysis in Python and R
- Coaching engineers and project management
- Systems design and data engineering: databases and data pipelines
